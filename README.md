# Readme-Generator1

This app creates a README file based on a number of prompts. It uses Node.js and inquirer.

# Challenges

My main challege was trying to learn how to get the data into the .MD file. Also using node and dealing with dependencies.

# What I learned

This is my first project using both Node.js and inquirer. I feel like I have learned a lot and have a little bit more confidence with them. I feel like I have learned a basic understanding of both.

Here is a screenshot of the application.
